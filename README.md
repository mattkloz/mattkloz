Howdy, I’m @mattkloz (this has been my username since my AOL days (early 90's), or Matt Klosinski as I'm known more formally.

I'm a Product Designer, Developer and Prototyper of Enterprise Solutions. To be honest, I have trouble describing myself (for better or worse) but I tend to say that I just enjoy building things that solve real problems. I'm of the "fail fast" school of development, I find that solutions come the quickest when I build -> seek feedback -> refine -> seek feedback -> refine. Constructive conversations are vastly more productive when we're all looking at the same thing.

Most of my work is client-side but I have full-stack experience in .NET, Ruby on Rails and Laravel (PHP). I'm fairly goofy and opinionated - I'm always up for a good technical discussion, I don't easily back down but I'll always admit when I'm wrong and you're right. I care a lot about what I put my time into so I like to do things the right way, not the easy way.

I firmly believe that most application work could/should be done on the client but to handle some of the backend tasks that clients aren't good at (think tail-optimized recursion), I've recently been using more and more serverless functions (AWS Lambda and Azure Functions). I'm also a big proponent of utilizing serverless architectures to reduce duplicative code - write once and share everywhere.

Of all the projects I've had the opportunity to work on or lead, my favorite types are bridging the "corporate gap" between the dev and project management teams. I enjoy building scalable solutions that allow PM teams to create development tasks that are more qualified, succinct and ultimately make the developer experience better. Developers spend way too much time on perfunctory tasks when their expertise should be in value-add tasks (doing the brain damage work that can't be otherwise automated).

I've been incorporating ML solutions into my projects to help improve solution malleability. Solutions that solve thing here might not solve it there - building with the goal of reducing brittleness is necessary.

### Recent Project Experience

- A few recent projects have included "translation" functionality and that's something I'd like to do more of. Those projects included an enterprise application UI builder that is platform agnostic but accepts plug-in translators to output to any platform or UI framework (built using vue.js, node.js and compiled as an Electron Mac app) including the ability to incorporate serverless functions and auto-deploy to Azure. 
- I've recently worked on a cryptocurrency project, built in .NET, that is a "form builder" that is build around a translator to output the form as a fully-fledged smart contract with the goal being to write once-deploy anywhere. This translator app is packaged in a Docker container with a private Ethereum sandbox for users to create a smart contract in the builder and then translate the contract to Solidity, deploy and test without having to understand Ethereum, blockchains, smart contracts or anything technical.
- I built a firewall running CentOS on a RaspberryPi and a UI app layer (vue/node) that allows an admin to manage the firewall rules remotely. The use-case of the project was to allow company executives and network administrators to detect network peripherals making unauthorized http requests.
